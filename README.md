Project Specifications:
•	Self-organize into groups of 4 students
•	Pick a data set that you and your group find interesting. (Example source: UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Feel free to select your data from any other source as appropriate. See Semester Project Resources for additional locations for datasets.)
•	Form a research question

Data Sources: 
1) Using google mobility data (https://www.gstatic.com/covid19/mobility/Global_Mobility_Report.csv?cachebust=6d352e35dcffafce) 
Here's the csv documentation: https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/data_documentation.html?hl=en
And 
2) NYT COVID data ( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv ): 
And
3) dataset on educational attainment and rural/non-rual by county: https://data.virginia.gov/dataset/EAG-Educational-Attainment-by-Locality/vzbr-xc9q

Semester Project Description
Project Specifications:
•	Self-organize into groups of 4 students
•	Pick a data set that you and your group find interesting. (Example source: UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Feel free to select your data from any other source as appropriate. See Semester Project Resources for additional locations for datasets.)
•	Form a research question
•	Perform data pre-processing, data cleaning, outlier removal, and so on to sanitize your data as necessary.
•	Save your data in a .csv file (or other format as appropriate for your data set and project scenario).
•	Read in data to your program from the data file.
•	(Optional - do as appropriate) Process the data or perform any calculations or statistics on it before storing the data into a data frame (see next step).
•	Save the data into one or more data frames (or other structures as appropriate)
•	Once you have stored your data, explore your data to reveal interesting/useful information based on your project scenario.
o	Query your data using at least four (4) different queries (questions). You can certainly have more than four questions
•	Write at least two (2) unit tests. For example, these might be short tests to show that two different functions work as intended. Did you test your code in other ways? If so, include what testing activities you carried out in your presentation/report. 
 
Deliverables:
1. WRITTEN REPORT (no more than 10 pages) containing:
•	Abstract: Paragraph outline describing your question, what you did, and what you learned
•	Introduction: Describe your project scenario. Starting out, what did you hope to accomplish/learn?
•	Data description: Describe your data set and its significance. Where did you obtain this data set from? Why did you choose the data set that you did? Indicate if you carried out any preprocessing/data cleaning/outlier removal, and so on to sanitize your data.
•	Data processing methodology: Describe briefly your process, starting from where you obtained your data all the way to means of obtaining results/output. 
•	Results:
- Show at least four (4) visualizations (at least one for each of your queries/questions)
- Display and discuss the results. Describe what you have learned and mention the relevance/significance of the results you have obtained.
•	Testing: Describe what testing you did. Describe the unit tests that you wrote. Show a sample run of 1 or 2 of your tests (screen captures or copy-and-paste is fine).
•	Conclusions: Summarize your findings, explain how these results could be used by others (if applicable), and describe ways you could improve your program. You could describe ways you might like to expand the functionality of your program if given more time.
•	Beyond the original Specifications [extra-credit]: highlight clearly what things you did that went beyond the original specifications. That is, discuss what you implemented that would count towards the extra-credit portion of this project. Examples of extra-credit opportunities:   (If you choose to do this, be sure to mention clearly in your write-up what you did.) 
o	Web-scraping to obtain your data set instead of downloading a ready-made data set from a source
o	Have some user-interaction where you may obtain some more data from a user (if appropriate)
o	Have some user-interaction where the user may choose the kinds of queries to perform on the data. Retrieve/display only the appropriate result
o	Use advanced queries or manipulate the data in another way (other data manipulation methods, etc..) and display the results.
o	... If you think of something else, please let me know! 
 
2. PRESENTATION
•	Each group will give a presentation not to exceed 10 minutes
•	The presentation should briefly include:
- research question
- data summary
- data processing methodology
- visualizations
- results
- conclusions
•	The presentation file format should be PowerPoint (PPTX) or PDF
•	The file name should begin with GroupName[n] where [n] is your group number.  For example: Data Wizards[7].pdf
Be sure to practice beforehand, and time yourselves. All members of the group must participate in the presentation. How you divide up the work, however, is entirely up to your group! 
 
3. CODE
•	Clearly document (clear header and code includes comments), organize, and name your code file or files
•	The files can be in Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts (or a combination)
 
Submission:
•	In one Zip file submit through Collab: (1) written report; (2) presentation (e.g. PDF or PowerPoint PPTX); (3) code files; and (4) [optional but recommended] a README.txt file describing the items in your ZIP file, especially if you have multiple code files and/or other included files.

Meeting Notes: 


Meeting 2/8/22
- Coding Tasks
	-Greg: import and start cleaning/filtering Google mobility data
	-Wenwei: import and start cleaning/filtering NYT COVID data
	-Mariska: import and start cleaning/filtering educational attainment and rural/non-rural by county data
	-Catherine: clean up and clarify our list of 4 research questions on the Google Doc and think about which vizualizations we want (looks like we need at least 4 -one for each question) and what code we might use to implement those once the final combined dataset is ready. 
	-Mary: How do we join these 3 datasets together and run initial descriptive analyses based on our questions?
